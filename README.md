## Testing ##
- When on mobile view or website is less than 800px/900px, website will respond to rework of the website design to exclude some content but not information to simplify the structure of the website for mobile view.
  - Galaxy Fold view had multiple compability issues, therefore, some content need to be reworked.
- Validated through [W3C HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) and [W3C CSS Jigsaw Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/). No errors occured.
- There was an issue with the Get-it button as it only worked on the header while the rest of the same button does not work, this was because it recongized only one button. To work around this, I used href and linked it to the javascript that does the same function to pop up the modal window.
- Within the footer, if there is no email written and submitted, border will turn red.
